# What is Digital Rights Management?

Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a set of technologies used to control access to copyrighted digital content. In the streaming industry, DRM ensures that video and audio content can only be played by authorized users on authorized devices.

<InfoBox title="Key Purpose">
DRM protects content creators and distributors from unauthorized copying and redistribution of their media. Without DRM, streaming services couldn't offer premium content from major studios.
</InfoBox>

## Why DRM Exists

The streaming industry relies on DRM to:

- **Protect Revenue**: Prevent unauthorized sharing that could undermine subscription and rental models
- **Enforce Licensing**: Ensure content is only viewed in licensed regions and timeframes
- **Satisfy Studios**: Major content providers require DRM as a condition for licensing
- **Control Quality**: Restrict high-quality streams to secure devices

## The DRM Ecosystem

A complete DRM system involves multiple components working together:

### 1. Content Preparation

Before content reaches users, it must be:

1. **Encrypted** using standard algorithms (typically AES-128)
2. **Packaged** into streaming formats (HLS, DASH)
3. **Protected** with DRM-specific metadata

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                          │

│                              [DRM Metadata]              │
│                                     ↓                    │
│                              [CDN Storage]               │
│                                                          │

### 2. License Server

The license server is the brain of the DRM system. It:

- Receives license requests from clients
- Validates user entitlements
- Generates and delivers decryption keys
- Enforces playback policies

<KeyConcept term="License">
A license is a cryptographic package containing the decryption keys and usage rules for a piece of content. It's delivered to the client after successful authentication.
</KeyConcept>

### 3. Client/CDM

The Content Decryption Module (CDM) runs on the user's device and:

- Generates license request challenges
- Processes license responses
- Decrypts content in a secure environment
- Enforces output restrictions

## The Three Major DRM Systems

The streaming industry is dominated by three DRM technologies:

| System | Vendor | Primary Platforms |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Widevine | Google | Android, Chrome, Smart TVs |
| FairPlay | Apple | iOS, macOS, Safari, Apple TV |
| PlayReady | Microsoft | Windows, Xbox, Smart TVs |

<InfoBox title="Multi-DRM Strategy">
Most streaming services implement all three DRM systems to ensure compatibility across all devices. This is called a "multi-DRM" approach.
</InfoBox>

## Security Levels

DRM systems define different security levels based on how keys are protected:

<SecurityLevel level="L1" description="Hardware-based security. Keys are processed in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Required for HD and 4K content." />

<SecurityLevel level="L2" description="Hardware-assisted security. Cryptographic operations in hardware, but content processing in software. Limited to SD quality." />

<SecurityLevel level="L3" description="Software-only security. All operations in software. Most vulnerable, typically SD only." />

## The License Flow

Here's how a typical DRM transaction works:

```
┌────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│ Client │     │   License   │     │   Entitlement  │
│  App   │     │   Server    │     │    Backend     │
└───┬────┘     └──────┬──────┘     └───────┬────────┘
    │                 │                     │
    │  1. Request     │                     │
    │  License ──────►│                     │
    │  (Challenge)    │                     │
    │                 │  2. Validate User   │
    │                 │────────────────────►│
    │                 │                     │
    │                 │  3. Authorization   │
    │                 │◄────────────────────│
    │                 │                     │
    │  4. License     │                     │
    │◄────────────────│                     │
    │  (Keys+Policy)  │                     │
    │                 │                     │
    │  5. Decrypt &   │                     │
    │     Play        │                     │
```

<RedTeamNote>
The license request contains device-specific information that helps identify the CDM. Attackers target this exchange to extract keys or spoof device identities.
</RedTeamNote>

<BlueTeamNote>
Defenders implement certificate pinning, request signing, and anomaly detection to protect the license exchange from manipulation.
</BlueTeamNote>

## Common Encryption Schemes

DRM systems use standardized encryption schemes:

### CENC (Common Encryption)

Common Encryption allows content to be encrypted once and protected by multiple DRM systems. The encrypted content is the same; only the license delivery differs.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Single Encrypted Asset          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│   ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐ │
│   │Widevine │  │FairPlay │  │PlayReady│ │
│   │ License │  │ License │  │ License │ │
│   └────┬────┘  └────┬────┘  └────┬────┘ │
│        │            │            │      │
│        └────────────┼────────────┘      │
│                     ▼                   │
│            [Same Content Key]           │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Encryption Modes

- **AES-CTR**: Counter mode, used by Widevine and PlayReady
- **AES-CBC**: Cipher Block Chaining, used by FairPlay (SAMPLE-AES)

<ConceptCard title="Key ID (KID)" icon="key">
Each piece of encrypted content has a Key ID that identifies which key is needed for decryption. The client sends this KID to the license server to request the appropriate key.
</ConceptCard>

## DRM Limitations

Despite their sophistication, DRM systems have inherent limitations:

1. **Analog Hole**: Content must eventually be displayed, creating capture opportunities
2. **Software Vulnerabilities**: L3 CDMs can be reverse-engineered
3. **Key Sharing**: Valid keys can be extracted and shared
4. **Perfect Security Impossible**: Any system that allows playback can theoretically be broken

<WarningBox title="The Security Trade-off">
DRM aims to make circumvention difficult and expensive, not impossible. The goal is to protect content during its most valuable window (theatrical release, initial streaming availability) while accepting that determined attackers may eventually succeed.
</WarningBox>

3. **[PlayReady](/knowledge-base/playready)** - Microsoft's enterprise DRM
4. **[Encryption Basics](/knowledge-base/encryption)** - The cryptography behind DRM

## Summary

- DRM protects streaming content through encryption and controlled key delivery
- Three major systems dominate: Widevine, FairPlay, and PlayReady
- Security levels (L1-L3) determine content quality restrictions
- CENC enables multi-DRM with single encryption
- No DRM is unbreakable, but effective DRM raises the cost of piracy
